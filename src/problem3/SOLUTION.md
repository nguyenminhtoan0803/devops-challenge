# 1. Edge Layer
   CloudFront CDN: Provides global content delivery and DDoS protection
   Route 53: DNS service with health checks and failover routing
   AWS WAF: Web Application Firewall for security
   Alternative considered: Cloudflare (rejected due to AWS integration benefits)

# 2.API Gateway Layer
    WebSocket API Gateway: Handles real-time price updates and order status
    REST API Gateway: Manages traditional HTTP endpoints
    Application Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across services
    Alternative considered: Kong API Gateway (rejected due to managed service benefits)

# 3.Application Layer (Trading Services)
    Order Matching Service
        Runs on ECS with EC2 launch type for predictable performance
        Uses multiple AZs for high availability
        Auto-scaling based on order queue length
    Price Service
        Similar infrastructure to Order Matching
        Handles market data aggregation and distribution
        Alternative considered: Kubernetes (rejected due to operational complexity)

# 4.Data Layer
    Primary Storage
        Aurora MySQL (Multi-AZ): For user accounts, orders, transactions
        ElastiCache Redis (Multi-AZ): For order books and real-time market data
        TimeStream: For time-series market data
        Alternative considered: MongoDB (rejected due to ACID requirements)

# High Availability Strategies:
#    1.Multi-AZ Deployment
        All critical services deployed across 3 AZs
        Active-active configuration for load distribution
        Automatic failover for database and cache layers

#   2.Scalability Approach:
        Horizontal scaling for stateless services
        Vertical scaling for database layer
        Cache layer scales horizontally with read replicas

#   3.Data Consistency:
        Eventually consistent model for price updates
        Strong consistency for order execution
        Write-through cache pattern for order books

# Future Scaling Plans:
#   1.Short-term (2x current load)
        Increase ECS task count
        Add Redis read replicas
        Optimize database queries
#   2.Medium-term (5x current load)
        Implement database sharding
        Add regional failover
        Introduce cache warming mechanisms
#   3.Long-term (10x+ current load)
        Consider multi-region deployment
        Implement database federation
        Add specialized trading engines for different asset classes

# Response Time Optimization:
#   1.To achieve <100ms p99:
        Use provisioned IOPS for critical databases
        Implement connection pooling
        Optimize network paths using placement groups
        Cache hot data in ElastiCache


#   2.Monitoring:
        CloudWatch metrics for system performance
        X-Ray for request tracing
        Custom metrics for trading engine latency

# Cost Optimization:
#   1.Infrastructure:
        Mix of Spot and On-Demand instances
        Reserved instances for baseline capacity
        Auto-scaling based on time of day trading patterns
#   2.Data Management:
        Data lifecycle policies for S3
        TimeStream time-based data retention
        Automated backup cleanup
